## ⚠️ Action Items Before Submission

### CRITICAL (Must Complete)

**What to add:**
```
Company Name: [Your registered business name]
Registered Address: [Your physical business address]
Registration Number: [If applicable in your jurisdiction]
Contact Email: admin@kojomoney.com
```

**Where:** Currently shows "KojoMoney App" - update this to your legal entity.

**Why:** Google Play requires the legal entity information to be publicly accessible. This is mandatory for app verification.

#### 2. Complete Play Console Data Safety Form
When filling out the Data Safety section in Play Console, declare:

**Personal Information Collected:**
- ✅ Email address
- ✅ Username
- ✅ Phone number (optional)

**Financial Information:**

- ✅ Other user-generated content

**Device & Advertising IDs:**

- ✅ Device ID

**Data Security Practices (Answer YES):**

**Data Usage Purposes:**

**Data Sharing:**
- ✅ Shared with third parties (ad networks, survey partners)
- List specific partners: Google AdMob, Meta Audience Network, Unity Ads, AppLovin, Lootably, Torox, CPX Research, Pollfish, etc.

#### 3. Verify Withdrawal/Rewards Information
Update your Terms of Service with specific examples if you have them:

**Add if available:**
- Specific minimum withdrawal amounts (e.g., "$5 USD equivalent" or "5000 points")
- Specific conversion rates by region (if you have them)
- Payment method fees (if any)

**Current status:** The terms now state "varies by region" which is acceptable, but more specificity is better.

## 📱 Additional Recommendations

### 1. Create a Support Email Alias
Consider creating dedicated support emails:
- `privacy@kojomoney.com` - for privacy requests
- `support@kojomoney.com` - for general support
- `dpo@kojomoney.com` - for Data Protection Officer

Currently using `admin@kojomoney.com` for all - this is acceptable but less professional.

### 2. Add FAQ Page (Optional but Recommended)
Create `/faq` page covering common questions:
- How long does withdrawal take?
- What payment methods are available?
- How do I delete my account?
- Why was my account suspended?
- How do I contact support?

### 3. Consider Adding a Dedicated "How We Protect Your Data" Page
This could enhance user trust and provide more detail than the privacy policy.

### 4. Terms Version History (Optional)
Consider maintaining a changelog of terms updates:
```
Version 1.1 - January 2026: Added loyalty program terms
Version 1.0 - December 2024: Initial release
```
