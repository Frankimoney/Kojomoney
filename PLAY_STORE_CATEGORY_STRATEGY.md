**Decision:** Use **Lifestyle** category instead of Finance

```
Thank you for your review. KojoMoney is positioned as a lifestyle rewards platform 
where users engage in daily activities (watching videos, reading news, playing games) 
for entertainment and personal enrichment. The point system is supplementary to enhance 
user engagement. Users are primarily using the app for lifestyle and entertainment 
purposes, with the rewards being an additional benefit.

The app fits well within the Lifestyle category as it enhances users' daily routines 
and provides value through content consumption and community engagement.
```

### If They Ask to Recategorize:
- Don't fight it
- Respond within 24 hours
- Recategorize to Finance if required
- Resubmit quickly

---

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation

### You're Still Compliant Because:
1. ✅ Your legal pages are complete and accurate
2. ✅ You disclose all financial activities
3. ✅ Terms clearly explain the rewards program
4. ✅ Privacy policy covers all data usage
5. ✅ You're not hiding anything

### Category Choice is About Positioning:
- Categories are for **user discovery**
- They help users **find relevant apps**
- Lifestyle users DO use rewards apps
- This is a legitimate positioning choice

### Precedents (Successful Lifestyle Rewards Apps):
- **Swagbucks** - Often categorized as Lifestyle
- **FeaturePoints** - Lifestyle/Entertainment
- **CashKarma** - Lifestyle
- **Honeygain** - Tools/Lifestyle
- **Panel App** - Lifestyle

---

## 📊 Success Metrics to Track

After approval, monitor:
1. **Download rate** - Is discovery working?
2. **User retention** - Are users engaging?
3. **Category ranking** - Where do you rank in Lifestyle?
4. **Search visibility** - Do people find you for "rewards"?

If Lifestyle doesn't work for discovery:
- You can request category change later
- No need to resubmit the app
- Just update in Play Console
